forthwith certify the same unto our court of commission
for causes ecclesiastical, to be there examined, and pro-
ceeded in with all fidelity and tendemess of our royal
majesty, as is due to us their sovereign lord and governor.
But forasmuch aa we well perceive, that the misleaders5

of our well-minded people do make the more advantage
for the nourishing of this distemper among thern from
hence, that the fdresaid rites and ceremonias or some of
them, are now insisted upon but only in some dioceses,
and are not generally revived in all places, nor constant-ly 10
and uniformly practised throughout all the chnrohes of
our realm, and thereupon have been liable to be quar-
relled and opposed by them who use them not; we there-
fore out of our princely inclination to uniformity and
peace, in matters especially that concern the holy worship ¹5
oi God, proposing to ourself herein the pious examples
of king Edward Vl. and of queen Elisabeth, who sent
forth injunctions and orders about the divine service and
other ecclesiastical matters, and of our dear father of
blessed memory king Jamea who published a book ofao

right of parliament, to the property and liberty oi the subjecta, and
matters tending to sedition and oi dangerous consequence.” Bold
and unquestioned as these resolutione were, it appears thet the com·
mons were not without their doubts respecting them. A bill was
brought in on the 3d oi June 1641, ior making the canons void, and25
punishing the authors oi them; and though the bill was not proceeded
with, it seems to bave been abandoned from the persuasion that the
most direct and effectual method, the method which they immediately
adopted, was to impeach the thirteen bishops by whom the canons had
been compiled. ³0
After the restoration, these canons again became the subject oi dis·
cmsion in parliament, and it is stated by some writers that they were
formolly abrogatedby the statute ¹3 Car. ΙΙ. c. ra. But it is clear, on
a perusal of that statute, that it leaves them to their own proper
synodicnl authority, and merely provides that nothing contained in that35

statute shall give them the force of an act of perhament.
