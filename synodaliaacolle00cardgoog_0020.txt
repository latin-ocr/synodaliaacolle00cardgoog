PREFAOE. xi

ratification of the XXXIX Articles iu the year ¹57¹ , although
the convocation on several occasions dispatched business ol
importance, enacting canons, which iu oue instance have be·
come the settled laws of the church, in another were rejected
by the sovereign‚ and in a third have been overpovvered by
the uniform opposition of public sentiment, its general history,
from the time ot* the Reformation to the period of the great

rebellior, consisted merely of aida and subsidias constautly in·

creasiug in amount, and carried at last tc the fatal experiment
of free benevolences.

Contrary as these facts might seem to the probabilities ol
the case, they were in reality a natural result arising partly
from the condition of a synod itself, aud partly from the many
substitutas that were found for it in governing the national
church. The powers of the archbishop, great in themselves,
and still greater when viewediuhis high station aa the president
oia synod, had reoently been augmented iu the eyes of true
ehurchmen by the rejection of the pope, and the supposed
transfer of the most sacred elementa of his office to the pri·
mate. Το aid this impression there was a tradition in the
church that in ancient times he was iuvested with the author·
ity ofa patriarch3 and it was a nannai consequence that when
the Roman pontiff had been stripped of this as well as other
usurpations, it would revert, whatever might be the amount
of it, to its original possessor. In the earlier periods accord·
ingly that followed the Reformation, when the conditione ofa
visible church were generally understood, and the necessity of
a spiritual head to preside over it was distinctly acknowledged,
the power of the archbishop was a most effective instrument
for church govemment. Being also under the direct and ab·
solute dominion of the sovereign‚ conferred according to bis
will, and liable to be smpended at his displeasnre, it was a
most valuable auxiliary for state purposes, and contracted by
a natural reciprocation something of the iufluence and au·
thority of the civil ruler. Eveu at a recent period, when an-
cient jurisdictions had been disputed and invaded, archbishop
Tenison was strongly urged to publish a book of family devo·
tions ou his own authority, not because it was equivalent to
that of a convocation, butas being more easily obtained, and
equally conclusive in effect among the members of the church.
