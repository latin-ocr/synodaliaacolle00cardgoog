said place of the apostle, as our cardinalized Jesuit hath
done⁰; or that it can be collected out of tho scriptores,
that either Christ, or any of his apostles, did at any time
teach or preach‚ that they who meant ιο be baptized,
must receive that sacrament upon condition, that if nt5
any time afterward, they should not be obedient to
St. Peter, for his time, and ιο his successore, they were to
lose and be deprived of all their temporal estates and
possessions3 or that it can be proved, either out of the
scriptume, or by any of the said ancient fathers, or shewed 10
in any ancient form of administration of baptism, that
ever there was nny such covenant made, by any such
faithful persons, when they were baptized, or required of
them ιο be made by any that baptized them; or that if
suoh a coronant were by Christ’s ordinance to be made in 15
baptism it ought not as well to be made by farmers, by
gentlemen possessed of mauors, and hy lords of greater

princes; or that it were not an absurd imagination to
think, that Christ and his apostles did only mean, thetae
emperors, kings and sovereign princes should be received
to baptism upon the said condition 3 or that all Christian
men ought not ιο judge, that the eleven apostles, if tbey
had known of any such bargain, or condition in baptism,
would have dealt as faithfully with the church, and in the 25

as now our cardinal and other such like persons of the
Roman strain, do by their writing, publishing, and main-
taining of it in the behalf of the hishops of Rome; or
ι that either Christ or his apostles, knowing that baptism 30
ought to be received with such a condition, did think it
convenient, that the same should be concealed, not only
whilst they lived, but for many hundred years afterward,
until the bishops of Rome should be grown ιο such a
