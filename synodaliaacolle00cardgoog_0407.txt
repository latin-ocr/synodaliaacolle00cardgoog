opportunity to establish that kind of govemment in the
churches of the Gentiles, being converted to Christ, heth
any more force to discredit it, than hed the want of it for
many years amongst the Jews to blemish the dignity of
it, when it was there established3 or that the apostless
had no further authority of chnrch-govemment committed
unto them, after the resurrection and ascension oi Christ,
than they had before his passion; or that there was not
as great necessity of sundry degrees in the ministry,
whilst the apostles lived, one to mle, another to be ruled, ιο
for the establishing and govemment of the chureh, as
there was whilst the priesthood of Aaron endured; or
that Christ himself did not, after a sort, approve of divers
degrees of ministers, some to have preeminence over
others, in that having ohosen to himself twelve apostles, 15
he did also elect seventy disciples, who were neither
superior nor equal to the apostles, and were therefore
their inferiors3 or that he did not very expressly, alter
his escension appoint divers orders and degrees of minis·
ters, who had power and preeminence one over another,2o
apostles over the prophete and evangeliste, and the evan-
geliste over pastore and doctore: or that the authority of
preaching‚ of administration of the sacramente, and of ec-
clesiastical government, given to the apostles, was not to
be communicated by the apostles unto others, as thero25
should be good opportunity in that behelf ; οι· that
because there vvere some persona] prerogativae belonging
to the apostles, which they could not communicate nnto
others, therefore they had not power to communicate to
some ministers, as vvell their authority of government3o
over other ministers, ss their authority to preach and nd-
minister the sacraments3 or that in the authority of
govemment so to be communicated unto others by the
apostles, there are not included certain degrees to be in
the ministry, some to rule, ahd some to be ruled; or thatas
it was not lawful for the apostles to choose unto them·
