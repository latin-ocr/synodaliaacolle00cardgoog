It might reasonably be supposed, from considering the na-
ture of a convocation, as claiming to represent the great body
of the olergy‚ that it would at all times be treated as the legis-
lature of the church, and be enhusted with the granting of
aida and subsidies from the clergy, and with the enactment ot'
ecclesiastica] laws. But if we follow the course of its history,
we shall find thatin this latter department, which would seem
to come most properly within its province, it has not in reality
exercised its natural rights. It was not permitted to pass its
judgment on the second Servios-book put forth by authority of
