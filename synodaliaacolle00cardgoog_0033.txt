is a selection made equally and by themselves from the clergy
at large, much less a selection of any kind from the whole
body of the faithful, but merely that it is invented with the
real character and power of the church. It ishowever to the
former meaning of the word representation that the spirit of
modern times has uniformly tended, and the tendency has
been promoted and established by the changes that have been
made in the constitution of the state. (the incongruity more·
over which has followed in the construction ofa synod, has
been increased in a multiplied progression, from the greater
prominente and the augmented numbers that have been ac-
quired by the parochial clergy, and the diminished and de-
pressed condition of the chaptera Under such circumstances
and with the current of public opinion borne so strongly in
the opposite direction, it may reasonably be ashed whether a
synod so constituted could wisely be employed to accomplish
any work of difficulty, obtaining no respect or syrnpathy from
churchmen in general, and regarded with suspicion or jealousy
by the clergy themselves.

Has the church then been hitherto drifting in the wide
ocean of accidente? We answer,

--— Pater amisso fluitantem errare magistro
Sensit, et ipse ratem nocturnis rexit in undis.

But though it may be granted that synode from their consti-
tution are ill suited to the actual condition of the church, and
from past experience of their conduct have been condemned
toa perpetual silence, the church is not lest without its out-
ward and effectual forms of government. Let it be remembered
that the articles of religion, the liturgy and the homilies, the
standards of the national saith, have all been approved by
synods as well as parliaments3 and though they arc not un-
chengeable in their nature, being ordained only by man's au-
thority, still it is unreasonable to assume that they are in want
of correction, and unwise on amere assumption to create faci·
lities for correcting them. Such authority¹¹ in short es isat
present requisite is rather executive than legislative.
