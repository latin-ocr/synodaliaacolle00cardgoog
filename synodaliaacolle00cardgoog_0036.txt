such motives make no impression, end the strong urm of the
lewis the only valid argument, the bishop is supported by acts
of the legislature, and the civil swerd is placed in his hands
for the punishment of evil doers. And whatever consideratione
of this kind apply to eny n'ngle bishop‚ they apply with in-
ereesed effect to the primate, then whom we acknowledge no
highcr spirimal person upon cartu If then, apert from the
wide range of his jndicial powers, we suppose him ιο have
tehen counsel with his suffragans, and to express his opinion
on a question, on which any members of the church have
honestly been secking for it, there can scarcely be desired an
authority more conclusive with the parties themselves, or more

authority. It may be conceived from the inexact methods of
legislation and registration in earlier times, that some docu-
menta of this description may heve been altogether lost, or at
least have been hended down in an imperfect condition, but,
ifthis were the case, it would only increase the desire thet all
such papers as are still to be obtained, should be brought into
one body, and publishedinthe precise forms which were known
to be authoritative. The articles accordingly of the year 1562,
fumishing one of the most remarkable examples thet could heve
been given of the case, are taken from the printed edition of

ference to the original MS, whichis still extent, und still bears

corrected before the articles were retified by the queen. And
this is only one instance out of many, where areoord of the
convocation, the document which et first sight would seem ιο
be conclusive, is in reality superseded by a printed copy, the
