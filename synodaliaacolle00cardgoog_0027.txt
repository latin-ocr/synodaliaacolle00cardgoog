xviii PREFAOE.

occurred, from being brought before other tribunale. But
when tho court oi high commissioni was abolished, and the
spirit oi the times removed much of the restraint which had
previously been imposed upon the prese, occasions vere con·
stantly arising for the interference os some churoh authority,
and a spiritual judge was wanted, whose ann could reach to
every part of the kingdom, and strike terror into every species
of offender. This duty, which the bishops' courts, however
adequate to their own respective dioceses, were too restricted
or too feeble to discharge, was undertaken by the convoca·
tion ; but the case of Toland, a cese that occurred aa early as
the year 1701, and seemed likely to try their strength to the
uttermost, soon furnished them vith reasons lor doubting
whether they possessed any jurisdiction in such matters. Their
doubts were confirmed by several legal opinions that were
given against them 3 and it was not till the year r 711, when
the memorable case oi Whieton had roused the spirit and
strengthened the resolution of the clergy, that the twelve
judges were commanded by the queen to give their opinion
on the subject, and eight oi their number, together with the
attorney and solicitor general, deelared themselves in favour of
the authority of convocation. In the midst, oi the warfare
then raging between the two homes, these questions led to
fiuther discord in some imunses, and to a realour cooperation
in others. Among the most remarkable were the cases of
bishop Burnet and doctor Samuel Olarlr03 but the most for·
midable and fatal opponent was bishop Hoadly, whose ‘⁴ Pre-
servative against the non-jurors” and “ Sermon on the kingdom
of Christ,'’ written in defence of the existing government, and
shielded by their publio approbation, lod to the virtual extinc-
tion of convocatione. In the year 1717, the lower house drew
up a hostile representation respecting those books3 but it had
not yet been laid before the bishops, when the king's govern-
ment sent down a writ of prorogation, being wmned hythe
great scandal ol some former oonhoversiea and dstermined to

protect a prelata, who was the emnest advocate of their own
opinions. From that day the convocation appears to have
been doomed to a perpetual silence.

Alter this general nansdve some observatione would seem
to be required respecting the relations of the two houset to

each other, and of the whole body to the great authorities of
