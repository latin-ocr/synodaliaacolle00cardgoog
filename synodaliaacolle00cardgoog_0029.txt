But a more important question was the relation subsisting
between a convocation and a parliament And here it must
be remembered that two large parties iu the commonwealth
may set ont in their views of government from two opposite
principles, the one maintaining that by a law oi Christianity,
allquestions relatingtoreligion, whetherinthe way of doctrine
or of discipline, must be determined by the church, the other
that by a law of nature, all questions whatever affccting thc
intereets cf society must be determined eventually by the
supreme legisleture. Itis easy to conceive that occasions
might arise from cases of a mixed nature when these two
principles would be brought into dangerous conflict 3 and that
in such cases uo remedy could be found but the prudencc,

. which trains and modifies them as they occur, and treats them

throughout the whole period os their existence with extreme
cantion and mutual forbearance. And such appears to have
been the conduct, that has generally been pursued with regard
to the opposing claims of convocation end parliameut. As
early as in the year ¹547 the lower olergy petitioned the
house of commone “ thetl according to the ancient custom ot*
this realm and the tenor of the king’s write for the summoning
ol the parliament, ..... the clergy of the lower house of convoca-
tion may be adjoined end associate with the lower house of
parliameut; or else that all such statutas and ordinances as
shall be made concerning all mptters ol religion and causes
ecclesiastical may not pass without the sight and assent of the
saidclergy.” In the year 1571,whentheXXXIX articleswere
under the consideration of the commone, and it appeared to be
their wish to omit a certain number of them, arohbishop Parker
remonstrated with their committes, and suggested that in the
whole of that matter they should defer to the judgment oi the
bishops. In like manner queen Elizabeth repeatedly ordered
that bille regarding the church should first be approved by
the olergy: king J ames 1, when he found the commone deal·
ing with the perilous subject of excommunication, desired that
they would first confer with the convocation respecting it:
and king Charles Ι. empowered the convocaticn of 1640 to
continue sitting, aiter the parliament had been dissolved, aud
