latter being the earliest known record which cau be shewn to
have obtainediull synodical authority. '

Doubtless there are many minds so constituted, that adcoree
of convocation, attested hythe subscriptione of all its members,
would appear to have a moral force and obligation that needs
no further sanction to make it imperative; audit may readily
be allowed, that such a deorse, where it has not been negatived
by the sovereign, either by bis express condemnation, or by
the mere omission of it from the authorized record, is entitled
to every degree of respect and deference, short of the implicit
obedience that is due to a positive law. But questions of go·
vernarent are not matters of private feeling or individual in-
terpretation. It is manifest that no mere decree of convocation
can be binding either in law or in conscience, whatever may
be the moral force it possesses, since it has been solemnly de-
clared by the church as well as by the stata, that all such
decrees are utterly invalid, until they have received the appro-
bation of the sovereign.

In this class of authoritative documenta are naturally added
the memorable canons of 1640, which were adopted by the
convocation of that period, and obtained the sanction of king
Gharles 1, but by the overpowering weight of circumstances
have never passed into acknowledged lawe of the church. The
history of these canons affords one of the most remarkable in-
stances on record of the paramount force of public opinion in
its ordinary and healthy condition, when opposed to enaot·

ments, which are admitted to have been formal in their origin,
but were passed ata time of disordered principles and extreme

discord. Historically, however, they are entitled to a place
among the documento of the church, and, besides other colla-
teral advantages, are of considerable walue in the moral lesson
they inculcate.

But in addition to this first and most important class of
synodical records, there are other decrces of convocatione,
possessed of no authority whatever, but entitled to be received
into a collection of ecclesiastica} documents, on account of
their intimate connection with the history of the church in
some of its most critical periods, and the striking illustratione
they afford of its character and nutrire. Such for example are
the canons, so called, of 1606, first published under the direc-
