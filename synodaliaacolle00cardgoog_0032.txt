tieslly totlmd the force of which hes not at cll times been
fully esu'rneted. When the deorees of e synod heve become
the acts os e parliament, the former legideture bes lost its
mnerity over them. It ounnct reperl them, it cannot
modify them, it cannot poss any other decrees inconsistent
with thern. The whole power is lodged for the future in the
hands ol parliament3 and whether the practicol inconveniente
urising from this result be great or otherwise, it is beyond the
resch of e remedy, end is one of those cases where the duty
on the one side is to acquiesce and on the other to forbesr,
the whole disorder being lest in esch individual instance to

proctor from each chapter, ond two proctors from the clergy
of esch diocese. “ Inm this province therefore the lower
house consiste of so decus, 24 proctors for the chapters, 53
trchdeocous, in the whole 99 of the cathedral clergy3 ond
there ere but at the same time 44 proctors for the parochisl
clergy.” Now it is declered in the canons of king J emes thet
