aesented to those memorable oenons, of which lord Olmendon
says that “ in the best of times they might have been question·
ed, and were sure to be condemned in the worst.” The house
cf commous resisted, in some instances temperately‚ in all
instances firmly,these varied solicitations. To the remonstrance
oi archbishop Parker their committee anawered in the person
of Mr. Wentworth, that they would pass nothing without
examination. They replied to the orders of queen Elisabeth
with assurances of dutitirl submission, at the same time prc-
ceeding steadily in their mensures of church reform. Become
more bold'under a wealrer sovereign they declared the con-
ference recommended by king J ames to be unprecedented and
derogatory from their privileges, although they were willing
to confer with the hishops as lords of parliament. But a het·
ter conclusion may be drawn from their conduct ou two sub-
sequent occasions, when the chnrch and the stete had been
brought into ecural collision, and the merite of the whole

when the changes made by tlte convocation in the book of
Common Prayer were debated in the house of commone, it
was decided, though only by a small majority, to adopt them
without examination3 and with a still greater deference to
the authority of the chureh, in the year 1689, when the bill of
comprehension was before the commone, they pehtioned the
king to summon a convocation, as the more proper assembly
sor discussing ecclesiastical questions. In this sentiment the
lords afterwards concurred, and a joint address was presented
to the throne prayiug that “ according¹ to the ancient practice
and usage of this kingdom in time of parliament, his majesty
would be graciously pleased to issue forth his write, as soon
as conveniently might be, for calling a convocation cf the
alergy of this kingdom, tc be advised with iu ecclesiastical
manen?

Nevertheless, although the reasonable claims of the convo·
oetion have been practically admitted, and the precedente 'that
would be quoted in their favour are at once the most recent in
their occurrence, and the most distinct in their declaration, it is

. clear from the nauue of the cese that the parliament possesses
