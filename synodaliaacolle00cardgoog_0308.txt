nually defend and use the same. This resolution and
practice of our churoh bath been allowed and approved
by the censure upon the Communion-book in king
Edward the Sixth his days, and by the Harmony of Con-
fessions of later years: because indeed the use of this5
sign in baptism was ever accompanied here with such
sufficient cautious and exceptione against all popish super-
stition and error, as in the like cases are either fit or
convenient.

First, the Church of England, since the abolishing of 10
popery‚ bath ever held and taught, and so doth hold and
teach still, that tho sign of the crosa used in baptism is
‚ no part of the substance of that sacrament: for when the
minister, dipping the infant in water, or laying water
upon the face of it, (as the manner also is,) hath pro-¹5
nonneed these words, “I baptiza thee in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost‚” the
infant is fully and perfectly baptized. So as the signos
the oross being afterwards used, doth neither add any
thing to the virtue and perfectior] of baptism, nor being 20
omitted doth detract any thing from the effect and sub-
stance of it.

Secondly, it is apparent in the communion-book, that
the infant baptized is, by virtue of baptism, before it be
signed with the sign of the cross, received into the con- 25
gregation of Christ’s flock, as a perfect member thereof,
and not by any power ascribed unto the sign of the eroes.
So that for the very remembrance of the cross, which is
very preeious to all thern that rightly believe inlesus
Christ, and in the other respecta mentioned, the Churoh 30

of England hath retained still the signos it in baptism:
following therein the primitive and apostolical Churches,
and accounting it a lawful outward ceremony and honour·
able badge, whereby the infantis dedicated to the service
of him that died upon the orosa, as by the words used in35
the Book of Common Prayer it may appear.
