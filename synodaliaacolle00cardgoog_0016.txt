Pession. ys

pnt in progrsss sordre purpose of completing the separation
between the chorches oi England and Rome, the king gave his

ament to the bill which ratified the submissior of the clergy.
Their actis expressed in that memorable statute (25 Henry
VIII. chnp. ¹9·) in the following manner:

“ Be yt therefore now enacted by aucthoritie oi this present
parliament according ιο the said submissior and peticiones the
said cleregy, that they ne enny of them from hencefirrth shall
presumo to attempt, alege, clayme or patin ure any constitu·
cions or ordinsncys provinciall or sinodalys, or any other ca-
nons, nor shall enact, promulge or executa any suche canons3
constitucione or ordinanncc provinciall‚ by whntsoever neme or
names they may he called, in their convocacions in tyme com·
myng‚ whiche elway shal be assembled by auctorite of the
hinges wrytt‚ oneles the same cleregy may have the lingis
moste roiall assent and licenoe to make, promulgo and executa
suche canons, constitucione and ordinanncys, provinciali or
sinodall, upon pain of every one of the said cleregy doyng
conhury to this act and beyng thereos convicte, ιο suffer enr-
presonament, and make Iyne et the king’s willd.'’

From these words it is evidcnt that the king was deter· ,
mined to hind his ietters in such a manner that no strength
or artifice on the part of his prisoner should enable him to
escape from them3 and we know from the subsequent history ol
