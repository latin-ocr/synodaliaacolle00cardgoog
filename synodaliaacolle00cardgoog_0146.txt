28. Os the bordes supper.

The Suppes of the Lord is not onlya signs of tbo loue
that Christians ought to haue among¹ thom selues one to
another: but rather it is a Sacrament of our redemption
by Christos death. lnsomuoh that to suche as ryghtlie,5

worthyly, and with faytb reooaue the same, the broad
whiohe wo breaks is a parttakyng of the body of Christe,
and likewyso tho ευρρε of blessing is a parttakyng of the
blood of Christe.

Trsnsubstantiation (or tho ohaungo of the substaunooso
of bread and wine) in the Supper of tho horde, ean not
be prouod by holye urit: but is repugnaunt to the playne
wordes of scripture, ouerthroweth tho nature of a Sadra-
ment, and bath gouen occasion to many superstitious.

The body of Christe is gouen, taken, and eaten in the15
Suppes, only after an heauenly and spirituall maner:
And tho monne wheroby the body of Christo is reseaued
and osten in the Supper, is fayth.

The Saorament of tho Lordes supper, was not by
Christos ordinaunoe reseruod, ouryed about lyfted up, or ιο

worshipped

29. Of aa wished which do notente tle body os Christe
ia tte ose of tte Lordss Suppes.

'l'he wished, and suche as be voydo of a liuolye fayth,
although they do carnally and visibly presso with theyr25
tosth (as Saint Augustius sayth) the Sacrament of tho ’
bodye and blood of Christ: yet in no wyse aro they par-
takers of Christe, but rather to theyr condemnation do
sate and drinko tho¹ signo or Sacrament of so great a
thing. 3⁰

30. Os bost kiades.

Tho oupps of the hordeis not to be denyed to the layo
psople. For both the partes of tho Lordos Sacrament,¹
by Christos ordinante and oomnraundsmont, ought to bo
ministred to all Christian men alyko. 35
