justioes of assiae to be oereful in the execution of the
said lawe committed to their trust, as they will answer to
God for the daily increase of this gross kind of supersti-
tion. And further, we do also exhort all judges‚ whether
ecelesiastical or temporal‚ upon the like account, tbat5
they would not admit in any of their courts any vesatious
complaint, suit, or suits, or presentmeuts against any
minister, churehwerdens, quest-men, side-men, or other
chnrch officere for the making of any such presentments.

And lastly‚ we enjoiu that every bishop shall once inm
every year send into his majesty’s high court of chaueery
a signficavit of the names and snmames of all such
recusant· who have stood excommunicated beyond the
time limited by the law, and shall desire that the writ
de eaoommnnicato capiendo might be at once sent out15
against them all aa officio. And for the better execution
of this deame, this present synod doth most humbly
besecch his most sacred majesty, that the officere of the
said high court of chancery, whom it shall concern, may
be commanded to send ont the aforesaid writ from timeo
to time as is desired, for that it would much exhaust the
particular estates of the ordinaries to sue out several
writs at their own charge. And that the like command
also may be laid upon the sherill's and their deputies, for
the due and faithful execution of the said write, as often 25
as they shall be brought unto them.

And to the eud that this canon may take the better
and speedier effect, end not -be deluded or delayed, we
further detrec and ordaiu, that no popish recusant who
shall persist in the said sentence of excommunicatione
beyond the time prescribed by law shall be absolred by
virtue of any appeal iu any ecclesiastica] court, unless the
said party shall first in his or her own person, and not
by a proeton take the usual ooth de parando J'ari, el
stando mandatis ecelesia. 35
