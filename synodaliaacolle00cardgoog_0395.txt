sin (both the high-priest’s son and thc rest) who either
refused to offer sacrifice, or to pray for Casan or that
the high-priests then ware not a wicked brood, dege-
nerated far from their first institution3 or that they did
not greatly offend God, in permitting the people to bes
infected by their inferior priests, and other religione per-

sons, with any of the said false positions and traitorons
conceits3 or that they (the said high-priests) did not
most grossly crr in all those points and particulare,
wherein they opposed themselves against the person and ιο
doctrine of our Saviour Christ3 hc doth greatly err.

XXXV. ll any man shall affirm either that the Son
of God (according to the doctrine of the Old Testament)
was not the governor of all the world3 or that he did
not appoint under him divers kings, princes, and civil ¹5
magistrates, to rule and govem in the kingdoms and
places assigned unto thenr; or that having so appointed
them, he did not himself direct, uplrold, and rule them
by his omnipotencc, according to his divine wisdom;
and might not, in that respect, be truly called the Lol-dno
os dorda and the God of pedm or that all the world, and
the particular kingdoms and civil kinds of govemment in
the world, were not in respectos the Son of‘God, as he
is the governor of the world, and the Lord os orda and
God os goda, one kingdom, principality, or govemment25
(thereby to impeach the mild and temperate govemment
which he had established amongst the Jews 3) or that he
ever committed the govemment ol all the world, after
Adam and Noah’s times, to any one man, to be the sole
and visible monarch of it; or that the said kingdom of30
Christ, as he was the Lord os dorda and God os goda, and
so govemed the whole world, was otherwise visible upon
the earth, than per portae, viz. by the particular king·
doms, and kinds of civil govemment, or perhaps by some
representation3 he doth greatly err. 35
