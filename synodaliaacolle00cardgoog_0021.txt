xii PREFAOE.

ι government was the court cf high commission, which had the

double advantage of being authorized by statute, and yet left
at liberty to darive its weapons from the inexhaustible armoury
of the hing’s prerogativa. It was the policy of queen Elina-
beth to emplcy the authority of this court for all the purposes
ot' the churoh, whether executive or legislative, considering

the prelatas whom she placed in it, with the primate at their ·

head, aa a delegation from the house of bishops, and acquiring
the further advantage of controling their opinions by means
of the other commissionem appointed from among her own
ministare. Doubtless this court, from the unbounded extent
cf its jurisdiction and the extreme cogcncy cf its measures,
was an instrument admirably adopted for the hands of an ab·
solute ruler; but Elisabeth seems also to have considered it
as capable cf sustaining any weight of odium or resistance that
might be occasioned by her rigorous vicws cf church disci-

And beyond and above all these methods of coercion and
direction was the supremaoy of the crown, which at the time
of the Reformation may be said to have combined the rights
of an absolute monarch with the spiritual domination of the
pope, and to have been restrained in the personel exeroise of
the latter functione only by its own act cf sels—denial admitted
Ι and confirmed by the legislature. The oath of supremecy,
provided in the statute, (ι Eh'z. c. 1‚) declared the queen to
be the “only supreme governor cf che realm, es well in all
spiritual and ecclesiastical things or causes, as temporal ;” and
there was nothing to exclude her from “challenging authority
andpower of ministry of divine service in the church,” until
she expressly renounced it inber Injuncticus of the year 1559,

and allowed her renunciation to be confirmed by an act of par-

liament in the year 1571, when the XXXIX Anticles of
religion became the law of the land.
But although these high and rival authorities were sufficient
