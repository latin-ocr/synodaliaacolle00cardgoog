ii PREFAOE.

spects, if placed by the side of more modern information,
would be quoted in the way of contrast rather thau of resem-
blance. But at the periodos the Reformation a distinct form
and character were given to the external constitution of the
charch, owing partly to the extraordinary nature cf the case,
and partly to the temper of the reigning sovcrcign 3 and the
changes that were then effected, being of great importance not
only in their own natiue, but more especially in their connec-
tion with the history of English synod's, must be clearly and
particularly described.

The resistance which had at all times been offered to the
usurpatione of the papal see, and since the time of iring Ed-
ward ΙΙΙ. had been supported by the statutas of provisore and
praemunire, was employed by king Henry VIII. for the pro·
secution of his own purposes, and became in consequence the
occasion of great embarrassment to the clergy. Praeticea
hitherto ,allowed to pass without observation were now found
to be encroachments upon the rights of the crown, and were
brought under the cognirance of strict and penal laws. Of this
state of things the case of cardinal Wolsey, natanally the most
pregnant and impressive of that period, furnished the most
remarkable examples. He had been invested with legatine
authority by the pope, and had received full permission from
the king to exercise it. But blinded either by the grenness
of his spiritual dignities, or by his confidence in the continu·

manner, giving beneficas by prevention, and granting facultics
and issuing instrumente unlawfirlly, as to exposa both himself
and the clergy at'large who acted under his authority, to the
penalties of invading the king’s prerogativa. The opportunity
thus presented to Henry of placing the church at his mercy,
and employing it according to his own discretion in his con-
test with the pope, was too valuable to be neglected. ln the
year ¹529 an indictanent was preferred against the cardinal
upon the'statute cf premunire, which terminated in the loss
of his personal liberty and the forfeiture of all his property;
and the solemn notice was brought more completely horne to
the clergy in general by a succession of similar indictments.
To add to these warnings of impending danger, several bold
measure· of church reform obtained the assent of the crosso,
