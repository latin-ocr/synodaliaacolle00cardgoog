xri PREFACE.

“ eThe upper house having observed that tha moet part of
those unhappy differences which have arieen between the
bishops and clergy concerning the methodo of prooeeding iu
convocation, have been occasioned by a wrong notion of the
convocation’s being a parliamentary assembly; aud that the
forms of sitting and doing business ought to be regidated by
those of the parliament ; hare thought it necessary to causa
the recorde of our provincial synode and convocatione to be
exactly searched‚ and an extract to be drawn from thence of
the customary methodo of their maeting, acting‚ proroguing,
and dissolring, ae well before the Act of Submission, ²5 Heu.
VIII. c. 19, ae rince3 with proper proofe toeupport the truth
of every article3 and having duly examined and considered
the same, have thereupon come to the following resolutione z

“ 1. Itis the opinion of this house that the constitution of
our provincial synode and convocatione isin many particulare ἢ
’ very different from that of the parliament.

“ a. That it does not appear to thie house upon the strictest
inquiry they can make, that the convocatIon or synod provin-

liament spiritual ; nor can- we find in those necorde any ground
for any euch title.

“ 3. That both the word of eadburnment and the thing meant
by that wordgae distinguished from prorogatioa, are utterly
unknown bo obr recorda: nor can we find it was 'ever made
use ofin any royal write sent to the convocation, but only in the
19th of king J ames I. (and then, as we conceive, by the ignor· .
auce or inadvertency of the clerk who drew the writ). And
in the execution of it made in the other province, whose acte ἐ
alone of that year remain to ue, the convocation pursued its
own method, and was prorogued by the commissary of the
archbiehop, ae usual, thereupon.

“ 4. That all the continuatione of our convocatione or synode
provincial, aa they are in our records called prorogatione, so

are they properly euch: and the continuance of the business , ¹
before them from one session to another, depende not upon Ι

an'y imaginary distinction between adjournrnente -and proroga·
tione, (which we take to be newly coined to aerve a present
