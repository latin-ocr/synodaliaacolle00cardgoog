xiv- PREFAOE.

promoting the wallare of the ohurch or ol the stata appeared
to acquiesce in the necessity for some change, to prevent the
occurrence of any firture contestu between the clergy and the
commone. The one party naturally suggested that an uniform
system of melion, enforced by the same authority, should
prewuil throughout the kingdom3 and the other readily ae·
quiesced in a proposal, which not only dispensed equal justice
to all parties, but in doing so relieved their own adherente
from great oppression The experiment moreover had been
tried during the protectorate, and having been considered
successful had created a kind of necessity in its favour. The
clergy were swero that by surrendering this right of aelf-
taxation, they were abandoning many disputable pretensions
ol their predecessore in order to accomplish an arrangement
oi real usefulness3 but they probably did not foresee the ulti·
mate consequences of their measure, consequences, whieh
though remote were unavoidable, commencing in the imme-
diate disparagement of all ohurch synods, and terminating in
their virtual annihilation. This arrangement, adopted by all'
parties tacitly at the time, and never confirmed by any suffi-
cient authority, legislative or synodical, has since, like wild

planta in an intricate forest, become intermingled with provi· ι

sions of acts ol parliament, and taken lirm root among them3
being, as bishop Gibson has observet, the greatest alteration
ever made in the constitution without an express law.

It was soon found that convocatione were an empty pageant.
They were ol no value to the government3 they were re-
garded with some degree of jealousy by the bishops3 attend·
anos on them was irksome and harassing to the lower clergy 3
and it was only the sense of their constitutional importante,
and the sear that the ohurch would lose its proper influence in
the counsels of the nation, which made any party desire that
convocatione should still maintain adecent and determinate
existence. A time of great trouble followed, when all the
energies of the ohurch were needed, and its individual mem·
bers entering boldly into the condiet were the means of saving
both the ohurch and the state from impending destruebam
and yet convocatione continued silent The revolution was
effected, and one of its immediate consequences was to bring
the great body of the clergy into collision with the civil go·
