for the worthiness of their miniatry, did think it fit, by
a prescript form of decent and comely apparel, to hare
them known to the people‚ and thereby to receive the
honour and estimation due to the special messengers and
ministers of Almighty God: we therefore following their⁵
grave judgment, aud the ancient custom of the Church of
England, and hoping that in time newfangleness of ap·
parel in some factious persons will die of itself, do consti-
tute and appoint, That the archbishops and bishops shall
not intermit to use the accustomed apparel of their 10
degrees. Likewise all deam, masters of collegas, arch-
deacons, aud prebendaries‚ in cathedral and collegiata
charchas, (being priests or deacons,) doctore in divinity‚
law, and physic, hmhelors in diriuity, masters of arta,
and bachelors of lew, having any ecclesiastieal living, 15
shall usually wear gowns with standing collare, and
sleeves strait at the hands, or wide sleeves, as is used in

Ι the universities, with hoods or tippets of silk or sarcenet,

and square caps. And that all other ministers admitted
or to be admitted into that fiunetion shall also usually 20
wear the like apparel as is aforesaid except tippets only.
We do further in like manner ordain, That all the said
ecclesiastical persons above mentioned shall usually wear
in their joumeys cloaks with sleeves, commonly called
priests’ oloaks, without guords, welts, long buttons, or25
cuts. And ,no ecclesiastical person shall wear any coif
or wrought nigbtcap, but only plain nightoaps of black
silk, satin, or velvet. In all which particulare conceming
the apparel here prescribed, our meaning isnot to attri-
bute auy holiness or special worthiness to the said gar-30
ments, but for deceuoy, gravity, and order, as is before
specified. In private bouses, and in their studies, the
saidpersous ecclesiastical mayuseanycomelyand scholar-
