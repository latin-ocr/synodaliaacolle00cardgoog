en exclusive jurisdictiou ln most matters and e deoided supe·
riority in all When the subsidias of the elergy were formerly
imposed by themselves, they still could not be lovied in the
customary manner without the authority of parliament. The
only proper punishmeuts by which a't any time a convocation
cen enforoe its ordinances, areos a spiritual nature, and from
the character of different offences are least likely to he effec-
tive, where there isgreatest need of them. The chnrch indeed
might easily relieve itself from the incumbrance oi such offen·
ders; but if mensures of that nauus were properly within its
province, the individuale would still continue members of the
oivil community, end would only require a greater superin-

already complied with the decrees of a convocation before a
question can asise as tc the application oi the statute. But
there are others ci its members, who would share in its privi-
leges without takiug part in its sintice, aud if when the ohuroh
has been found insufficient to cope with this latter class oi
chnrchmen, the state should he induced to deal with them,
constreining them to live according to their profession, but
leaving them to profess according to their own judgrnent, it
is the aot oi the stete providing forits own interests, and the
wisdom or the folly of it must he given to the agent. From
this interposition however of the statute law a result has prec-
