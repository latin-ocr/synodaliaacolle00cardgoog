finden ample field 101 his exertions, and a large body 01 101-
lowers ripe 101 extreme mensures. The discussion had already
been opened by other writers ; but the book published by
Atterbury in the year 1700, entitled “The rights, powers and
privileges 01 an English convocation stated and vindicated,''
and the eloquence and intrepidity with which he followed up
his defence 01 the lower house, soon placed him attho head

and 01 demanding a free conferente between the two houses.
But the questions that were most earnestly debsted, and the
right judgment to be formed respeeting them, may be seen
from the following resolutioris adopted in the course 01 the

once to protect the upper house from the assaults 01 the lower
clergy, and the caussatione large from the more formidable

enmoechments 01 the civil power.
