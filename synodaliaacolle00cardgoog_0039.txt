m PREFACE.

The dmkness, which broods generally over the anuals of the
church, and is most remarkable in the history os its eouucils,
has been greatly increased by the destruction of the registers
of the uppcr house in the great lire of london, a loss, for
which the registers of the lower house make no oompensation,
owing to the inferiority of its powers aud the limited range of
its business. The deficiencies of earlier date have accordingly
been supplied, as far es the case admitted, by the use of the
best and most authentic editions ; and in the more recent
documento reoonrse has been hed to the voluminous collectione
oi archhishop Wahe, to which free access was granted in dre
library at Christ church, and many additions and corrections
have cousequently been made, which had escaped the diligence
of former collectore. Errors doubtless may have been still
continued ; but many others, some os which were of a serious
natue, bave certainly been removed.

The notes were too essential to the value of the work to be
treated with carelessness or compiled without discrimination.
They were intended to supplya knowledge of the motives
and details that constitute the living substance of history,
without which the reeder would in the present instance have
had before him the bare skeleton oi the church, considered in
its jurisprudence‚ and have been unable to form any oonjecture
as to its animatior or eetivity.

The work itseli completas the series of which the Editor
gave notice when he sent forth his two volumen of Docu-
mentary Annals. If the object should be answered that was
sought iu the publication of it, it will tend to support that
general sobriety ol mind aud principle, which, however occa·
sioually deraugcd hy faotione men, aud at convulsive periodo,
is among the many hlesdnga coniemed upon the natiou hy
the resormed church of England.
