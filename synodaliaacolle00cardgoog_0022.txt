tn cripple the power of convocatione, and to relieve them

from the discharge of their most important duties, there still
remained to them the office of providing subsidies from the
great and wealthy body whom they represented. 'lhis office
they fulfilled during the most trying periods of the monarchy
with constant and unabated loyalty, advancing large sums by
way of loun, taxing themselves to a great amount for terma of
years, and granting in several instances lavishly, and in one
instance fatrlly, a free benevolence. It is a fact worth observ·
ing, and only to be explained by the acknowledged connection
in interest and in existence between the church aud the
tbrnne, that these imporn, though frequently attended with
great hardship, were freely voted, and for the most part were
readily paid. But a benevolenee was a methodos raising snp-
plies which mure recommended to the sovereign by two most
important advantages. It was paid to him directly, and with-
out the liability of his rendering any account of it, and—what
became at last its most pernicious attribute—it did not require,
as all common subsidies did, to be confirmed and levied by

benevolence was to be collected, it needed no assistance from
the common penalties of the law. This was the measure to
which recourse was hed by Charles I. in the year 16403 and
archbisbop Laud, who was painfirlly alive to all the conse-
quences ofthe approaching conflict, but had not duly estimated
the relative strength and influence ot' the combatants, recom-
mended thet the benevolence should be raised, and took his
precedent from asimilar proceeding of archbishop Whitgiit in
1585, when the jealousy of the commone could not be cf·
fended, and the prerogativa of the crown was undisputed To
this act of archbishop Laud, above the other conspiring causes
os that evcntful period, may bc ascribed the complete and dis·
astrous alienation that followed between the church and the
parliament.

The recollection of this important measure, and of the great
constitutional interests involved in it, survived the long inter-
val of disorder, aud led at the periodos the restoration to a
new aera in the history of convocatione. All persons, whether
