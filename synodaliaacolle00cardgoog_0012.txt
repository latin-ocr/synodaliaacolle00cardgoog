PBEFAOE. iii

in opposition to the wishes of the clergy, but at the earnest so-
licitation of the house of commons3 and the general act of ,
pardon, which also passed in the parliament of the same year,
and might have been expected to shelter the olergy no less
than common criminals, especially excepted all offences against
the stamtes of provisore and praemunire.

Whilst the storm was thus collecting in its strength, the
convocation was vainly endeavouring to escape from it by
making some ineffectual attempta at the reformation of abusos,
and by remitting a loan which the king had formerly obtained
from them. In the following year, however, as soon as he had
ordered a translation to be made of the New treatment into
English, and had issueda proclamation forbidding the exer·
