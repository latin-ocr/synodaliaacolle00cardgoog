As the godlie consideration of predestination and our5
election in Christe is ful of swete, pleasaunte and un-
speakable coumfort to godlie personas, and soche as feele
in themselves the woorking of the spirite of Christ, mor·

lighte of Nature: For holie Scriptura doeth setta out
unto us onely the name of Jesu Christ, wherby menne
must be saved. 35
