tiones archbishop Sancrcst, with the title of bishop Overall’s
Convocation book, canons, that represent the extreme views of
church authority belonging tn the reign of king J ames Ι. but
were rejected by that sovereign witha degree of wisdom and
prudente, which, among his many inconsistencies, he fre·
quently shewed in the matters of the church, and very rerely
in his general government These canone may be considered
as the ecclesiastical code of a party, always respectable and
sometimes powerful, which has been raised up in the church
periodically, during times of discrder and disunion, as a tem·
pest is sometimes employed to stay the ravages of a pestilence,
and may be best exemplified by the conduct of the non-jurors
in the reigns of hing William and queen Anne.

Among the proceedings of convocatione it was not always
easy to determine what papers ought to be admitted and what
excluded There are manymemorials and representatione made
hythe two houses respectively‚ and especially at the period
os their great controversy, which being merely the opinions
of one member ol the legislative body, are of no real authority,
and have morsuver no peculiar velue in illrutrating the history
of the times. But among those proceedings there are in many
instances heads or noticee of legislatiom which could not rea-
sonably be omitted, whether they are regarded in their own
intrinsic importance‚ or in the mamre consideration they re·
ceived from both houses of the clergy. In such cases the
papers have been admitted, and their nature and value have
been explained in the notes that accompany them.

The proceedings themselves are for the most part copies of
the abridgments published by Willrins in his concilia, the
mere matters *of form being altogether omitted, and the re-
mainder being expressed aa much as possible in the words of
the original records. But in such memorable convocatione aa
those of the year 1562, 1640 and 1661, memorable not only
for the constmction of the XXXIX articles, the second book of
homilies, the canons of archbishop Laud, and the liturgy in
its present form, but also for the fact that the registers of the
upper house belonging to those periods have been singularly
preserved, it hes been thought right to republish the proceed-
