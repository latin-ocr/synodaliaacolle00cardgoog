tion now addressed themselves to him in person, deelaring
their “especial must and confidence in his excellent wisdom
and incomparable learning,'’ and promising during his natural
life to sorbeat from making or enforeing any constitutions with-
out his royal license and approbation. This promise was evi·
dently constructori with aview to its being withdrawn at a
future period, and was also expressed with such a reservation
of immunities and liberties that a degree oi suspicion was
thrown upon its immediate bearings. It was met with the
peremptory demand “ that no constitution or ordinante shall
be hereafter hythe clergy enacted, promulged, or put in ex-
ecution, unless the king’s bighness approve the mma by his
high authority and royal assent, and his advice and favour be
also interposed ior the execution of every such constitution
among his bighness' subjects.’' And this demand was in·
stantly followed by a measure pregnant with the most serious
consequences. On the next day, (May ιι, 1532,) the king
seut the following message to the house of commone: “ Web
thought that the clergy of our realm had been onr subjecta
wholly, but now we harewell perceived that they be but half
our subjecta, yea, and sceroe our subjecta. For all the prelatas
at their consecration malre an oath to the pope clean contrary
to the oath that they make to us ; so that they seem to be his
subjecte and not ours. The copy of both the osths Ideliver

ι bere to you, requiring you to invent some order, that we be

not thus deluded of our spiritual subjects.”

Overpowered bys necessity from which they had in vain
endeavoured to escape, and compelled to close their session
abruptly by the appearance of the plagae, the convocation
agreed to the act of submission, and presented it to the king
on the soth day of May, 1532, expressed in the following
terma:

“ We⁰ your most humble subjecta, daily orators and baads-
menos your clergy of England, having one special] trust and
confidence in your most excellent wisdom, your princely good-
nesse and fervent real to the promotion of God’s honour and
Christian religion, and also in your learning, fair exoeeding in
