XXXVI. If any man shall affirm, either that during
the continuance of the Old Testament, the merits of
Christ's death actually to come, were not sufficient to savo
all true believers3 or that there was then no catholic
ohurch; or that at any time there was any other rock but5
Jesus Christ, the blessed seed upon whom the catholic
chnrch was then built; or that many of the Gentiles
were not always (for aught that is known to the contrary)
true members of the catholic ohurch; or that Christ him· .
sclf was not the sole head or monarch all that while of 10
the whole catholic ohurch; or, that the said catholic
chnroh, after the members of it were dispersed into all
the places of the world, was otherwise visible than per
partes: or that Noah did appoint any man to be the
visible head of the said catholic ohurch; or that the 15
high-priest among the Jews, had any more authority over
the catholic church of God, than king David had over
the universal kingdom of God3 or that the said high-

priest had not greatly sinned, if he had taken upon him,
or usurped any such infinite authority; he doth greatly ιο
err.
