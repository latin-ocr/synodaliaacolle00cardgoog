PREFACE. ix

os summoue nov, by which they had been went to be assem-
bled under thet capacity heretosore, do plainly shew,) they
are by that writ empowered not only to meet, according to
the mandate of their metropolitan issned out thereupon, bnt

t being met, are authoriaed sreely ιο act in that capacity, with·

out any other restraint than that one, of not being any longer
at liberty to enforce their subsidias by ecclesiastical censures3
which indeed from thencesorth they could not do, because
they were by this act generally restrained from making any
canons or constitutions, provincial or synodical, without the
hing’s license; aud no exception or provision was made for a
liberty todo that in this one case, which they might not do
iu any other besides.

‘⁶ Accordingly, whilst they continued to grant their own
money, they had no need of any license either to debete of
or ιο corneto a final resolution upon any subsidias for the
government They granted them freely as before; and drew
up their granta into a solemn instrument3 and by their pre-
sident offered it under his metropolitica] seal to the king for
his acceptance.

“ 1f they had any addresses to make, or any petitione to pre·
sent to the bishops, the parliament, or the prince, they had,
and still have, a lull liberty to make and to offer them And as
before, isthey saw it needful to proceed to any proper synod·
ical debates, in order ιο the regulating of any thing that might
be wanting in the doctrine or discipline of the church, they
had an undoubted right to draw up their requests to their
archbishop and bishops for leave or directions to proceed
upon it, so I do humbly conceive, they may do the seme now:
only with this difference, that their petition must now run,
not for their leave or consent, (who are no longer able to grant
them any,) bnt that they would obtain the princa’s assent and
license, who alone, since this act, cau authoriae them in this
“And here, if I mistake not, the power of the convocation,
as such, determines. 1f they mean to proceed any firrther,
and ιο confer, not in order to a petition for a liceum, but (as
the judges well expressed it) to constitute canons, they must
first qualify themselves for such conferente hythe king’s
linense ; or they will come within the penalty os that statute
