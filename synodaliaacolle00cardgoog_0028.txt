the state. Each subject indeed is attended with its own diffi-
culties, and the latter of them is ol such a natue as to involve

mndicting principles, and to lead onward into dangerous

speculatione. But the statement may be susmmed by a con-
stant reference to facts, and with such a limitation will recom-
mend itself by its own natural importante.

'l'he house of bishops uniformly asserted and maintained
their superiority over the lower house. The archbishop as
president of the whole body possessedhis own individual rpri·
vileges; but the upper house, with the president at its head,
had the right of determining the sittings os the lower clergy,
of assigning the business to be prepared by them, of calling
for their assistance in committee, and confirming their election
of a prolocutor. The lower clergy could present petitione
containing complaints or suggestions, could offer amendments
on the propositione of the bishops, or render them of no effect
by finally dissenting from them. And this disparity resulted
naturally from the authority possessed by the bishops indi·
vidually over their respective presbyters, hom the higher
kind of sacredness attaching to their order, which, though not
openly maintained till near the end of Eliaabeth’s reign, was
one ol' the constant principles of her conduct, and from the
constitution ot‘earlysynods, consisting,as they did, of bishops
and prelstea only, the lower clergy having been called toge-
ther originally for advice aud counsel, and not acquiring a
distinct and permanent interest till they were found useful for
the purpose of grantingsubsidies. Itwasobserved accordingly
in queen Mary’s reign “ wicht what loffiness the bishops, few
as they were in number, carried it towards the lower house ;”
