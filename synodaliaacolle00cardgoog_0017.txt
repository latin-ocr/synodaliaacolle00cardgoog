the churcb, and the many fruitless attempta which bave been
made to obtain arelaxation ol them, that the king’s design bas
been eminently successful.

The effect produced upon the constitution of an English
synod by this joint act of the convocation and the parliament

may be stated in the words of archbishop Wahe: “ King

⁴ Henry the VIIIth being resolved to tie up the hands of the

clergy, that so they might not be in a condition of making any
considerable opposition to his designa ; in the first place, by
the latitude'of tha word Oonvocation, < which was now indiffer-

this effect3 the case of the convocation with respect to their
power of acting,1 take tc be plainly this: that being called
