itie geuon vnto them in the congregation, to cell end
sende miniatem into the Lordes vineyorde.

24. Osspeolyng in tlte congregation, in osolt o touque os
tle people mirandem.

It is a thing pleynely repugneunt to the words of God,5
and the eustome of the primitiue Ghurehe, to haue pub-
liqne prayer in the Ghnrohe, or to minister the Seors-
mentes, in e tongue not vnderstnnded of the people.

25. osne Sanamem.

Seornmentes ordeyned of Christe, be not only bedgesro
or tokens of Christian mens profession: but rather they
he eerteine sure witnesses and effectuall signes of grece
ond Gods good wyll towardes vs, by the which he doth
werke inuisiblie in vs, ond doth not only quieken, but
also strengthen and oonfirme our fayth in hym. 15

There ore two Seorementes ordeyned of Christe our
Lorde in the Gospell, thot is to say, Baptisme, end the
Supper of the Lorde.

Those fyue, eommonly called Seommentes, thet is to
say, confirmation, Pennunee, Orders Matrimonie, andan
extreme Unction, are not to be compted for Sacramentes
of the Gospel, being such es haue growen partly of the
corrupt folowing of the Apostles, partly are states of life
alowed in the scriptores: but yet hone not lylre nature of
Seerementes with Baptisme and the Lordes Supper, ξομε
thet they hene not any visible signe or eeremonie or-
dnyned of God.

The Saoromentes were not ordnynod of Christ to be
gssed spon, orto be ceryed about: but thot we shoulde
dnely vse them. And in such only, as worthyly reeeoueso
the seme, they haue a wholesome effect or operation:
But they thet reoeaue them vnworthyly‚ purohose to
them selues dommtion, os S. Paul seyth.
