the said catholic church, as if he meant to put the Holy
Ghost out of possession3 or that either the said one
universal kingdom of Christ (the King and Creator of it)
is otherwise visible upon the earth than by the particular
kingdcms and several kinds of govemments in it (ands
perhaps in a sort, and by representation, when some
neighbour kings, either in person or by their ambassadom,
may be met together for the good of their several king-
doms); or that the said one catholic churoh of Christ
(aa he is the chief bishop over all) is otherwise visible on 10
the earth than by the several and particular churches in
it, and sometimes by general end free councils lawfully
assembled3 or that it is abetter consequent, that if the
catholic church hare no visible head, all other bishops,
doctore, pastore, end ministers are needless; than if one 15
should say, becauoe there is no one king to govem all the
world, therefore there is no use of emperors, kings, and

sovereign princes, or civil magistrates; or that it doth
more follow, that Christ should have left his faithful
people in a confused anarchy, except he had left St. Peter ιο
and his successore to govern the whole church, than it
doth, that the whole world heth been left by him ina
confusion, without any govemment in it, in that he hath
not left one universal emperor3 or that the intolerable
pride of the bishop of Rome, for the time still being, ²5
through the advancement of himself, by many sleights,
stratagema, and false miracles, over the catholic church,
(the temple of God,) as if he were God himself, doth not
argue him plainly to be the man os sio mentioned by the
apostle3 or that every national church, planted according 30·
to tho apostles' platform‚ may not, by the means which
Christ heth ordained, as well subsint of itself, without one
universal bishop, as every kingdom may do under the
govemment of their several kings, without one general
monarch3 he doth greatly err. 35
