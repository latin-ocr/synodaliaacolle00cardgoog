LVII. The Sacramenta aot lo be refused ot tlte Houdsos
uepremdiay Ministcrs.

Whereas divers persons, seduced by false teachers, do
refuse to have their children baptized by a minister that
is no preacher, and to receive the holy communion at his5
hands in the same respect, as though the virtue of those
sacramente did depend upon his ability to preaoh3 foras-
much as the doctrine both of baptism and of the Lord’s
supper is sufficiently set down in the Book of Common
Prayer to be used at the administration of the said sacra-10

· ments, cs nothing can be added unto it that is material

end necessary: we do require and charge every such
person, seduced as aforesaid, ιο reform that their wilful-
ness, and to submit himself to the order of the church in
, that hehalf 3 both the said sacraments being equally ef· 15
fectual, whether they be ministered hya minister that is
no precabar, or by one that is a preaclrer. And if any
hereafter shall offend herein, or leave their own parish·
churches in that respect, and communicate, or cause their
children ιο be baptized, in other parishes abroad, and will ιο
not be moved thereby ιο reform that their error and un·
lawful course; let them be presented to the ordinary of
the place hythe minister, church-werdens, and side-men,
or quest-men of the parishes where they dwell, aud there
receive such punishment by ecclesiastical censures, as25
such obstinacy doth worthily deserve3 that is, let theru
(persisting in their wilfulness) be suspended, and then,
after a month’s further obstinacy, excommunicated. And
likewisc if any parson, vicar, or curate, shall, after the
publishing hereof, either receive ιο the communion any 30
such persons which arc not of his own church and parish,
or shall baptize any of their children, thereby strengthen-
ing thenr in their said errors; let him be suspended, and
not released thereof‚ until he do faithfully promise that
be will not afterwards offend therein. 35
