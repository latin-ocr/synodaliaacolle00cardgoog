, our bodies, must needs be picus in itself, profitable unto
us, and edifying unto others; We therefore think it very
meet and behovefirl, and heartily commend it ιο all good
and well affected people, members of this church, thats
they be ready to tender unto the Lord the said acknow-
ledgment, by doing reverence and obeisance, both at their
coming in and going out of the said churches, chancels,
or chapels, according to the most ancient custom of the
primitive church in the purcst times, and of this churchro
also for many years of the reign of queen Elizabeth.
The reviving therefore of this ancient and laudable custom
we heartily commend ιο the serious consideration of all
good people‚ not with any intention to exhibit any religious
worship to the communion table, the east, orchurch,15
or any thing therein contained in so doing, orto perform
the said gesture in the celebration of the holy eucharist,
upon any opinion of a corporal presence of the body of
Jesus Christ on the holy table, or in mystical elementa,
but only sor the advancement os God's majesty, and toro
give him alone that honour aud glory that is due unto
him, and no otherwise; and in the practice or omission
of this rite, we desire that the rule of eharity prescribed
by the apostle may be observed, which is, that they which
use this rite, despise not them who use it not; and that25
they who use it not, condemn not those that use it.

quired that all preachers (aa well beneficed men as others) ³0

shall positively and plainly preach and instruct the people ¹

in their public sermons twice in the year at least, that the
rites and ceremonias now established in the chnrch of
England, are lawful and commendable; and that they
the said people and others ought to conform themselvesg
