nors; or that the people's preposterous haste did any way
prejudice the dignity and authority of Saul's regal power,
or afterward of the sceptra of Judah3 or that the people
then had in themselves any authority to set up a king
over them (for then they would not have been so eamest5
with Samuel to make them ι king); or that after David's
advancement to ιιιι kingdom, he was not as truly called
thercunto by God himself, as Aaron was to the priest-
hood; or that David’s posterity had not by God’s ordi-
nanee as rightfirl an interest to succeed himin his said 10
kingdom, as either Aaron’s sons had to sueceed him in
the priesthood or Moses, Joshua, ιιι ιιι rest of the
judges, notwithstanding that (ιιι himself did choose, and
named them particularly, had in their goremments3 or
that the people then had any more authority to have15
withstood either David or any of his posterity from being
their king, than they ιιι to have repelled either Moses
or Joshua, or any of the rest of the judges, whom God by
name did appoint to govem them; ιι doth greatly
err. 20

XV. If any man shall affirm, either that the kings
in the Old Testament were not bound as strictly to ob-
servo the laws of God in their govemments, ιι were
Moses, Joshua, and the rest of ιιι judges; or that they
had any greater liberty todo what they list, than the ²5
others had; or that they had no authority hythe example
oi Moses, ιιι ol all the rest of their predecessore in their
princely government, to delegate and appoint such judges
and governors under them, as the other princes formerly
under them had appointed3 or that because ιιι said 30
kings did imitate the said princes, in appointing such
judges to assist them in the govemment of their king·
doma, therefore their govemments were ιο ιι judged
rather aristocratical than truly monarchical; he doth
greatly err. 35
