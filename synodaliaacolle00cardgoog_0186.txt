The queen appears to have coincided in sentiment with the arch·
bishop; for although in her speech at the close oi the session, she
reproved the bishopa aud told them thetis “they did uot emend laults
and negligentes, she meant to depose them,'' her object evidently was 25
not to reform the constitution of the church, but to obtain a more
exact conformity than they had hitherto required. She declared that
God had made herthe overrulerof the church, and said iu reference
to the Puritana that ‘⁴ she saw many overbold with God Almighty,
making too many subtle scaunings of His blessed will, us lawyers did 30
with human testamenta3 that the presumption was so great, that she
might not suffer it; aud that she must pronounce them dangerous to
alringly rule, every man, according to his own censure, making a
doom of the validity and privity ot his prince's government.” (D'Ewes
Journal, p. 328. Strype, Whitg. vol. i. p. 391.) The Puritans were35
defeated for the time, but they soon returned with additional smength,
and the contest was continued, until the church was overthrowu, and
its adversaries were buried in its ruins.
