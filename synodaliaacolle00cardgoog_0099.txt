is no direct informatiou as to the persons by whom the translation
was made; but it is reasonable to suppose that the same bishops who
compiled the Articles in their original Latin, would provide an English

the Eughsh Articles of 1553. There isintemal evidence to shew that
it was made by members or' theeouvocation, rather than under the
direction os the queen's enuncil. It is a remarkable fact, consistent
with this view os the case, but not otherwise easily explained (Dr.
Lamb's Articles, p. 34.), that this translation does not contain the 25
memorable clause on the authority of the chureh; but whoever were
the translatore, it is plain that they were acquainted with the altera·
tions made by the queen, alter the Articles hed been approved by the
convocatiou, (see the preceding No. p. 38.) ; for although they omit the
clause above mentioned, they aleo omit the Article ‘⁸ Impii non mandu- 30

eouucil had expunged. The Articles therefore in this edition are in
